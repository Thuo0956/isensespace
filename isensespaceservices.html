        <li>5.restaurants</li><p>By merging architecture and neuroscience we design spaces that evoke positive emotions and stimulate the appetite.This is achieved through our carefull examination and deployment of factors such as lighting intesity,colour temperature,and spatial layout of furniture to influence diners" perceptions of taste,mood and satisaction.Additionally, our incorporation of elements of sensory branding,such as signature scents and soundscapes,further immerses the diners in the restraurant"s atmosphere,forging a deeper emotional connection with the brand. </p></ol>
